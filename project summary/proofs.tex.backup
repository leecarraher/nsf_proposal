From Perpinan and Carriera we have:\\
Jacobian
$$
\textbf{J}(x^*) = {{1}\over{\sigma^2}}{\sum_{x\in X}{p(m | x)\mu_m{\mu_m}^\top - f(x)f(x)^\top}}
$$
Hessian
$$
\textbf{H}(x)={{\rho(x)}\over{\sigma^2}}\big(\textbf{J}(x)-\textbf{I}\big)
$$
Convergence Rate
$$
r = \underset{x\to\infty}{lim} {{|||x^{\tau+1}-x^*||}\over{x^\top - x^*}} = \lambda_{max} < 1
$$

following the proof of convergence for expectation maximization mean shift.\\
we propose the addition from JL-thm under a random subspace projection $\textbf{P}_{n\to m}, n>m$ 
and triangle inequalit distance preserving function $\textbf{d}(\cdot)$ , strictly:
$$
\textbf{d}(x,y)>\textbf{d}(\textbf{P}_{n\to m}^\top x,\textbf{P}_{n\to m}^\top y)
$$
therefor
$$
K(X)>K(\textbf{P}_{n\to m}^\top X), \forall x \in X
$$
then simply plug into the above jacobian.

Proof of missing a top k
$|B_k|$ is the cardinality of k
simplification of annexstein
$k = 1 \Rightarrow B_2$ is degenerate case\\
probability of exactly half in a population:
$$\bigg({2}^{-n}\binom{n}{n/2}$$ 
for nodes N its the probability of this not being even
as pigeon hole principle will force one of the nodes to have $> |B_k|/N$
$$\bigg({2}^{-n}\binom{n}{n/2}\bigg)^N$$
the assymptotic complexity is deminated by $c^{-nN}$ which converges fast!\\
figuring out what +1 means to the deviation under the cardinality distribution of
buckets is put off for now...(probably difficult)\\
now lets consider the bound on $|B_k|/N$ as $N$ increases:
This is simple, its power law convergence: $n \over N$
